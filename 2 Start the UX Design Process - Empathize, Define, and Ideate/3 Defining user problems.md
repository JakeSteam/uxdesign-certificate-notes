## Statements

These are all linked. You have a persona, what's their problem statement, what's the related hypothesis statement(s), how does a value proposition apply?

### Problem statements

> [Name of user persona] is a [type of user] who needs [type of user experience] because [benefits of user experience].

Covers the who, what, and why of the problem.

Characteristics:

- Human-centred
- Broad enough for creative freedom
- Narrow enough that it can be solved by a design solution

Benefits:

- Establish goals
- Understand constraints
- Define deliverables
- Create benchmarks for succeed

### Hypothesis statement

> Our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design problem might be.

No fixed format, examples:

- If [action] then [outcome]
  - If user X downloads app, they can make a purchase.
- User X needs an app that does x, y, z.
- We believe x for y will z
  - We believe that a simplified checkout process for users on the move will allow them to purchase more easily.

### Value proposition

> The reason why a consumer should use a product or service

1. What does your product do? Clearly explain the offering that your product provides users.
2. Why should the user care? Describe how your product addresses users’ pain points.

## Human factor

> The range of variables humans bring to their product interactions

This claims that before WW2, people were moulded to fit the machine, instead of the inverse? Seems an unlikely anecdote.

## Psychological concepts

- Mental models: Internal maps that allow humans to predict how something will work.
- Feedback loops: The outcome the user gets at the end of a process. Give feedback on good / bad actions.
- Von Restorff effect / isolation effect: The one that differs from the rest will be remembered.
- Serial position effect: More likely to remember first few and last few.
- Hick's Law: More options the user has, longer to decide.
