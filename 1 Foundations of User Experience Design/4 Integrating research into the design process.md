## UX Research

- Understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.
- Can help bridge the gap between what the business thinks a user needs, and what the user actually needs

## Types of research

- Foundational research (AKA strategic or generative) takes place before anything is designed:
  - What should we build?
  - What are the user problems?
  - How can we solve them
- Design research (AKA tactical) takes place during design phase:
  - How should we build it?
- Post-launch research takes place after launch:
  - How well is feature meeting users' needs?
  - Did we succeed?

## UX researcher qualities

- Empathy: Understanding others' feelings and thoughts
- Pragmatism: Practical problem-solving
- Collaboration: Work with range of people / work styles

## Methods

### Categorising

Two ways to categorise:

1. Who conducts: Primary research (conducted self) or secondary research (info from someone else)
2. Type of data: Quantitative (countable or measurable) or qualitative (why and how)

### Types

- Secondary research: E.g. looking up stats.
  - Saves time and money, immediately accessible, can back up primary research. However, no first-hand experience, might not be directly applicable.
- Interviews: Usually in person, open-ended questions. Use when detailed response required.
  - Understand what users think and why, can ask followup questions, but take time and money.
- Surveys: Many people asked same thing, to understand majority opinion. Qualitative AND quantitative.
  - Larger sample size, fast, cheap. But, feedback is not in-depth.
- Usability study: Identify pain points by getting users to try a prototype / product.
  - First-hand research, challenge our assumptions and get detailed feedback. However, only measure how easy product is to use, and are expensive. Might also be different behaviour IRL vs in lab.

## Kinds of bias

Bias: Favouring or having prejudice against something based on limited information.

### Biases and how to counter

- Confirmation bias: Looking for evidence to prove pre-existing hypothesis.
  - Ask open-ended questions
  - Actively listen without adding opinions
  - Include large sample of users
- False consensus bias: Assumption that others think the same way.
  - Identify & articulate own assumptions
- Primacy bias: Remember first participant strongest, because it's a new experience for you.
  - Take detailed notes / recording
  - Interview each participant the same way
- Recency bias: Easiest to remember latest thing heard / seen
  - Take detailed notes / recording
- Implicit / unconscious bias: Subconsciously associating attitudes / stereotypes to people. E.g. interviewing people from similar background, or asking an offensive question accidentally.
  - Reflect on own behaviour
  - Ask other people to point out your biases
- Sunk cost fallacy: Further in you are, harder to get out (gambler's fallacy!)
  - Break into smaller phases
  - Have milestones where you can stop if appropriate

Also:

- Framing effect: Users make a decision / choice based on the way information is presented.
- Bandwagon effect: Going along with other people's opinion.
- False consensus: Assuming others will think the same way you do.
- Social desirability bias: User answers based on what they think you want to hear.
- Availability bias: Rushing screening and only getting who is available. Issue that affects online polls.
