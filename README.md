# UX design notes

Miscellaneous notes made during study for [Google's UX Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/ux-design-certificate).

## Notes on notes

1. I typically only note things that I suspect I'll forget, or that don't make sense immediately. As such, my notes are only a small subset of the course's full content.
2. Each folder is a course, containing a `.md` per "module". E.g. my notes on Course 1 Module 1 [are here](/1%20Foundations%20of%20User%20Experience%20Design/1%20Introducing%20user%20experience%20design.md).
3. Finally, there's informal feedback throughout, these are reminders to myself for an article!
